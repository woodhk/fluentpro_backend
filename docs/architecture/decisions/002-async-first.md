# ADR-002: Async-First Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
FluentPro will integrate with multiple AI services (OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services) and needs to handle real-time communication features. These operations are I/O bound and can benefit from asynchronous processing.

## Decision
We will adopt an async-first approach:
- All views, use cases, and services will be async by default
- Use Django's async views (Django 4.1+)
- Implement Celery for background tasks
- Use Redis for caching and message passing

## Consequences
### Positive
- Better performance for I/O operations
- Ability to handle WebSocket connections
- Preparation for real-time features
- Better resource utilization

### Negative
- Complexity in debugging async code
- Need for async-compatible libraries
- Potential for race conditions
