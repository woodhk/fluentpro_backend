# ADR-001: Use Domain-Driven Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The FluentPro backend needs to handle complex business logic around user authentication, onboarding flows, and AI-driven communication scenarios. The codebase was becoming difficult to maintain with business logic scattered across views, managers, and services.

## Decision
We will adopt Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles:
- Organize code into domain modules (authentication, onboarding)
- Use aggregate roots to enforce business invariants
- Implement repositories for data access
- Use domain events for cross-domain communication

## Consequences
### Positive
- Clear separation of business logic from infrastructure
- Better testability through dependency injection
- Easier to understand and modify domain logic
- Natural boundaries for microservice extraction

### Negative
- Initial complexity in setup
- Learning curve for developers new to DDD
- More files and abstractions
