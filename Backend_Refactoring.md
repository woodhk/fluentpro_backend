Comprehensive Implementation Plan for FluentPro Backend Refactoring

  ## Phase 4: Testing, Debugging & DevOps (1.5 weeks)

  ### Week 8: Observability & DevOps


  #### Day 35: Environment Management and Deployment

  **Goal:** Complete environment-specific configurations, deployment setup, and health monitoring.

  **Step 4: Create comprehensive deployment documentation**
  
  **Actions:**
  1. Document deployment process
  2. Create environment setup guides
  3. Add troubleshooting documentation
  
  **Files to create:**
  - `docs/development/__init__.py`
  - `docs/development/deployment.md` (deployment guide)
  - `docs/development/environment_setup.md` (local setup)
  - `docs/troubleshooting.md` (common issues)
  
  **Files to modify:**
  - `README.md` (update with new setup instructions)
  
  **Verification:** New developers can set up and deploy following documentation

  ## Post-Phase Verification Checklist

  After completing all phases, verify the final structure matches `Backend_Refactoring_File_Path.md`:

  **‚úÖ Required Verifications:**
  1. **Directory Structure:** Final structure matches target blueprint
  2. **Async Infrastructure:** Celery workers, Redis streams, WebSockets functional
  3. **State Management:** Conversation state persists across requests
  4. **Testing:** ‚â•80% code coverage, all tests passing
  5. **Monitoring:** Structured logs, metrics, health checks working
  6. **Deployment:** Application deploys successfully in containerized environment
  7. **Documentation:** All patterns and processes documented

  **üîç Gap Analysis:**
  Any remaining gaps between current state and target blueprint must be documented and addressed in a follow-up phase.
