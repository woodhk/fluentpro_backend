Comprehensive Implementation Plan for FluentPro Backend Refactoring

  ## Phase 4: Testing, Debugging & DevOps (1.5 weeks)

  ### Week 8: Observability & DevOps


  #### Day 35: Environment Management and Deployment

  **Goal:** Complete environment-specific configurations, deployment setup, and health monitoring.

  **Starting State:**
  - Monolithic fluentpro_backend/settings.py
  - config/settings/base.py created in previous steps
  - No environment-specific configurations
  - Basic Dockerfile exists but may need enhancement

  **Step 1: Complete environment-specific settings structure**
  
  **Actions:**
  1. Ensure config/settings/base.py contains common settings
  2. Create development, staging, production specific settings
  3. Add environment variable validation
  
  **Files to verify/modify:**
  - `config/settings/base.py` (ensure proper base configuration)
  
  **Files to create:**
  - `config/settings/development.py` (development overrides)
  - `config/settings/staging.py` (staging configuration)
  - `config/settings/production.py` (production configuration)
  
  **Before:** Single settings file for all environments
  **After:** Environment-specific settings with proper overrides
  
  **Verification:** App starts correctly in different environments

  **Step 2: Add configuration validation and error handling**
  
  **Actions:**
  1. Create settings validation utilities
  2. Add startup configuration checks
  3. Validate required environment variables
  
  **Files to create:**
  - `config/settings/validation.py` (settings validation)
  - `config/checks.py` (Django system checks)
  
  **Verification:** App fails fast with clear errors for misconfiguration

  **Step 3: Create production-ready deployment configurations**
  
  **Actions:**
  1. Review and enhance existing Dockerfile
  2. Create development Dockerfile
  3. Add CI/CD pipeline configuration
  
  **Files to examine:**
  - `Dockerfile` (review existing configuration)
  
  **Files to create:**
  - `docker/Dockerfile.dev` (development image)
  - `docker/docker-compose.prod.yml` (production compose)
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (CI pipeline)
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (deployment pipeline)
  
  **Verification:** Application builds and deploys in containerized environment

  **Step 4: Implement comprehensive health check system**
  
  **Actions:**
  1. Create health check endpoints
  2. Add dependency health monitoring
  3. Implement liveness and readiness probes
  
  **Files to create:**
  - `api/common/health.py` (health check views)
  
  **Files to enhance:**
  - `infrastructure/monitoring/health_checks.py` (health check implementations)
  
  **Verification:** Health endpoints report system status accurately

  **Step 5: Create comprehensive deployment documentation**
  
  **Actions:**
  1. Document deployment process
  2. Create environment setup guides
  3. Add troubleshooting documentation
  
  **Files to create:**
  - `docs/development/__init__.py`
  - `docs/development/deployment.md` (deployment guide)
  - `docs/development/environment_setup.md` (local setup)
  - `docs/troubleshooting.md` (common issues)
  
  **Files to modify:**
  - `README.md` (update with new setup instructions)
  
  **Verification:** New developers can set up and deploy following documentation

  ## Post-Phase Verification Checklist

  After completing all phases, verify the final structure matches `Backend_Refactoring_File_Path.md`:

  **‚úÖ Required Verifications:**
  1. **Directory Structure:** Final structure matches target blueprint
  2. **Async Infrastructure:** Celery workers, Redis streams, WebSockets functional
  3. **State Management:** Conversation state persists across requests
  4. **Testing:** ‚â•80% code coverage, all tests passing
  5. **Monitoring:** Structured logs, metrics, health checks working
  6. **Deployment:** Application deploys successfully in containerized environment
  7. **Documentation:** All patterns and processes documented

  **üîç Gap Analysis:**
  Any remaining gaps between current state and target blueprint must be documented and addressed in a follow-up phase.
